# flutter_workshop_capco

This app allows the user to draw on the screen using different colours.

This project was done during Capco's first Technical workshops. We attempted to
learn flutter by recreating the app created during [this] episode of the
boring show. Below are some screenshots of what I came up with.

There are 5 buttons. 4 which change the drawing colour, and one which will clear
the screen.
